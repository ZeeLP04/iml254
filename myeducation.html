                    <p>When high school came around, I decided to take up the librarian role again because I needed to escape several situations that I could not get myself out of, and it was a good time for sure. There is a more challenging task, but I took it with strides.</p>

    <h2>A little bit known fact about me:</h2>
    <h5>Me feeling on top of the world:</h5>
    <img src="images/education8.jpg" style="width:50%;">
    <p>People call me Zee. They also said I write too much but hey what else can I do to help me make sense of every aspect of my life? My love for writing ties into one of my fears - memory loss. 
    <p>My earbuds and headphones have seen better days due to the hours of music and podcasts playing in my ear. I have thousands of music playlists for every mood because music is what fuels me as a human being.</p>
    <h3>I LIKE LATE-NIGHT DRIVES, WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN AS THE MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY IN THE CAR</h3>
    <p>So yeah, I would often say Im not hungry but then again, I love food as much as I love reading books so take that as you will. Cafe-hunting and taking pictures of the well-prepared dishes and drinks? Sign me up because thats what I called a good time.</p>
    <img src="images/education10.jpg" style="width:50%"><br>

    <h2>PERSONALITY</h2>
    <h5>Me rethinking my life decisions:</h5>
    <img src="images/education9.jpg"style="width:50%;">
    <p>It's hard to choose when both options provide the best benefit and satisfaction.</p>
    <p>I can't decide whether I prefer coffee or tea. Something is soothing about drinking tea, but on the other hand, coffee provides a strong sense of energy that can jolt you up. </p>
    <p>So I guess that kind of informs all of you that firstly, I'm an indecisive person who can always change his mind with the help of overthinking. And secondly, I'm just someone who prefers both coffee and tea.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>ASPIRATIONS</h2>
    <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
    <img src="images/education12.jpg"style="width:50%;">
    <p>Aspire to be bigger but cherish the child-like hopes and dreams</p>
    <p>Once, when I was a child, I dreamed of owning a two-story building. I have a vision where I would open up a coffeehouse/bookstore on the first floor of the building, while my residence would reside on the second floor, beneath the coffeehouse/bookstore. A cute dream pipeline that still brings a smile to my face.</p>
